`Class Objective`

This class is designed to **build understanding gradually**:
1. Start with **core AI concepts**
2. Move to **LLMs & Generative AI**
3. Understand **Agents & Agentic AI**
4. Learn **how developers interact with AI (CLI/GUI)**
5. Compare **real AI tools used today**

`What is AI?`

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is when machines:
- Think logically
- Learn from data
- Make decisions
- Solve problems

Example:
- Voice assistants
- Recommendation systems
- Chatbots

`What is Generative AI?`

**Generative AI** is a type of AI that:
- Creates **new content**
- Doesn’t just search or copy

It can generate:
- Text
- Code
- Images
- Music

Example:
- ChatGPT writing an email
- AI generating a logo

`What is an LLM?`
**LLM = Large Language Model**

LLMs are:
- Trained on massive text data
- Good at understanding & generating language

LLMs are the **brain** behind tools like:
- ChatGPT
- Gemini
- Claude

`What is an Agent?`

An **Agent** is an AI that:
- Receives a task
- Thinks
- Takes action
- Uses tools if needed

Simple definition:
> An agent is AI that **does tasks**, not just answers.

### Example
Task: “Create a website”
- Agent writes code
- Agent fixes errors
- Agent gives output

`Types of Agents`

### General Agents
- Can do many tasks
- Flexible
- Example:
  - ChatGPT
  - Gemini
  - Claude

### Custom Agents
- Built for **one specific job**
- Used in companies

Examples:
- Customer support bot
- Resume screening agent
- Code review agent

`What is Agentic AI?`

**Agentic AI** is advanced AI that:
- Plans steps
- Makes decisions
- Acts repeatedly
- Uses tools automatically

It works with **less human control**.

### Example
Task: “Deploy a website”
1. Plans structure
2. Writes code
3. Fixes bugs
4. Deploys project

`AI Agent vs Agentic AI`

| Feature | AI Agent | Agentic AI |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Single task | ✅ | ❌ |
| Multi-step planning | ❌ | ✅ |
| Autonomy | Low | High |
| Tool usage | Basic | Advanced |

Easy memory trick:
- **Agent** = Helper  
- **Agentic AI** = Independent worker

`What is CLI?`

**CLI (Command Line Interface)** lets users:
- Interact using text commands
- Work faster
- Automate tasks

Example:
```bash
git status
```

`CLI vs GUI`

| Feature     | CLI        | GUI       |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Mouse       | ❌          | ✅         |
| Keyboard    | ✅          | ❌         |
| Speed       | Fast       | Slower    |
| Ease of Use | Harder     | Easier    |
| Best for    | Developers | Beginners |

Examples:

* CLI → Terminal
* GUI → Apps, Windows
