🚀 Crash Course: Prompt Engineering, Git, GitHub & Vercel Deployment

Beginner-friendly • Simple English • Practical Learning

📌 What You’ll Learn

This class teaches you how modern developers work with AI, version control, and deployment tools.

By the end, you’ll be able to:

Talk to AI properly using prompts

Understand Git vs GitHub

Use basic Git commands

Deploy a website using Vercel

Clone a website using AI prompts

🧠 Part 1: Prompt Engineering (Talking to AI Properly)
What is a Prompt?

A prompt is the instruction you give to AI.

❌ Bad Prompt

Make a website

✅ Good Prompt

Create a responsive landing page using HTML and CSS for a fitness app with a hero section, features, and CTA button.

🧩 Prompt Best Practices
1️⃣ Be Clear

Tell AI exactly what you want.

Bad:

Write code

Good:

Write HTML and CSS for a navbar with logo on left and buttons on right.

2️⃣ Give Context

Explain who you are and what you need.

Example:

You are a frontend developer. Create a simple portfolio website for a beginner student.

3️⃣ Break Big Tasks into Small Ones

AI works best step-by-step.

Instead of:

Build Netflix clone

Do:

Create homepage layout

Add movie cards

Style using CSS

🧠 COT, TOT & Temperature (Very Important)
🔹 COT – Chain of Thought

Means: Ask AI to think step by step.

Example:

Explain how Git works step by step in simple words.

📌 Best for:

Learning

Debugging

Understanding logic

🔹 TOT – Tree of Thought

Means: Ask AI to give multiple solutions or paths.

Example:

Give me 3 different ways to design a landing page.

📌 Best for:

Design ideas

Brainstorming

Creative work

🔹 Temperature

Controls creativity level of AI.

Low (0.2 – 0.4): Accurate, boring, safe

Medium (0.5 – 0.7): Balanced

High (0.8 – 1): Creative, risky

Example:

Write a professional email (low temperature)
Write a creative brand slogan (high temperature)

🧑‍💻 Part 2: Git vs GitHub (Very Common Confusion)
🔹 What is Git?

Git is a tool that runs on your computer.

It helps you:

Save versions of your code

Track changes

Go back in time if something breaks

📌 Git = Version control system

🔹 What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website.

It helps you:

Store your Git projects online

Share code with others

Work in teams

📌 GitHub = Online storage for Git projects

🧠 Simple Analogy

Git = Camera (takes snapshots)

GitHub = Google Drive (stores photos)

⚙️ Part 3: Git Configuration (One-Time Setup)

Before using Git, you must tell it who you are.

🔹 Set Username
git config --global user.name "YourUsername"

🔹 Set Email
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"


📌 This info appears in your commits.

🔍 Check Git Configuration
git config --list


This shows:

Your username

Email

Other Git settings

🚀 Part 4: Vercel Deployment (Put Website Online)
What is Vercel?

Vercel lets you:

Deploy websites

Share live links

Host frontend projects for FREE

📌 Used for:

HTML/CSS

React

Next.js

🔹 Steps to Deploy on Vercel

Push your code to GitHub

Go to vercel.com

Login using GitHub

Click New Project

Select your repository

Click Deploy

🎉 Your website is now live!

Example

Local website:

index.html
style.css


After Vercel:

https://your-project.vercel.app

🧪 TASKS (Hands-On Learning)
✅ Task 1: Website Clone Using Prompts

Use AI to clone any website design (not code copy).

Example Prompt:

Analyze this website layout and recreate a similar landing page using HTML and CSS with your own content and colors.

Rules:

No copy-paste

Structure inspired, not stolen

Change content & colors

✅ Task 2: Deploy on Vercel

Push your project to GitHub

Deploy using Vercel

Share live link

🎯 Final Takeaways

AI is powerful only if you ask properly

Git saves your progress

GitHub stores your work

Vercel makes your site public

Prompts = Superpower 🚀

🏁 You’re Now Industry-Ready (Beginner Level)

These tools are used by real developers worldwide.
Mastering basics early gives you a huge advantage.
