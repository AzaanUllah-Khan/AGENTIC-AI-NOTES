`Core Concepts of Programming`

- There are five basic pillars of programming
  
    - Variables
    - Functions
    - Loops
    - Arrays
    - Conditional Statements

#### 1. Variables: 
Packets or containers where a data is stored
`eg: name = "Azaan"`

#### 2. Functions: 
Functions are reusable block of codes.

#### 3. Loops:
Loops are use to execute a set of code multiple types. There are 3 types of loops `for` `while` `do-while`

#### 4. Arrays:
Arrays are storage areas used to store multiple elements of same data types
`About Arrays` The index of arrays start with 0 whereas length starts with 1.

#### 5. Conditional Statements:
They execute the code based on the condition. If the condition is true it executes if block and if false it runs else block. There are also nested ifs which allows us to check condition within the if block.
